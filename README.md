# AI Solution Intern Case Study

## **Overview**
An automated investment report generation system that leverages Generative AI to create detailed, personalized portfolio analysis reports. The system processes client investment data and produces comprehensive reports with performance metrics, risk analysis, and tailored recommendations.

## **Key Objectives**
- AI-Powered Report Generation: Uses the facebook/opt-350m model for intelligent report generation
- Automate investment report generation with comprehensive portfolio performance analysis.
- Tailor reports to align with diverse client profiles.
- Ensure compliance with financial reporting standards by including necessary disclosures.

## **Features**

### **1. Automated Investment Report Generation**
 AI-Powered Report Generation
  - Automated report creation using Facebook's OPT-350M model
  - Personalized portfolio analysis and recommendations
  - Benchmark comparison against S&P 500


### **2. Tailored Content**
Customizes reports based on client profiles, including:
  - Investment Goals (e.g., Long-term growth, Capital Preservation)
  - Risk Tolerance (e.g., Moderate, Low, High)
  - Smart recommendations based on portfolio data

### **3. Compliance Assurance**
Includes mandatory disclaimers such as:
  - "Past performance is not indicative of future results."
  - "This report is for informational purposes only."
  - Adheres to financial reporting standards.

## **How It Works**
### **Prompt**
The following prompt structure is designed to generate comprehensive investment report summaries:
```
Client Profile:
Name: [client_name]
Investment Goal: [goal]
Risk Tolerance: [tolerance]
Time Horizon: [horizon]

Portfolio Performance:
Total Portfolio Value: [value]
Year-to-Date Return: [ytd_return]
Asset Allocation: [allocation_data]
Risk Metrics: [risk_metrics]
Benchmark Comparison: [benchmark_data]

Please provide a comprehensive investment summary that includes:
1. Portfolio Performance Overview
2. Asset Allocation Analysis
3. Risk Assessment
4. Benchmark Comparison
5. Recommendations aligned with the client's goals and risk tolerance
```

### **Test Samples**
Three distinct test samples have been developed to demonstrate different output scenarios. The data is structured in JSON format as follows:
#### **Sample - 1**
```json

  "clients": [
    {
      "client_id": "C001",
      "profile": {
        "name": "Pranav Raj",
        "risk_tolerance": "moderate",
        "investment_goal": "retirement",
        "time_horizon": "long_term"
      },
      "portfolio_metrics": {

        },
        "risk_metrics": {

        },
        "benchmark_comparison": {
          "sp500_return": 9.2,
          "relative_performance": -0.7
        }
      },
      "historical_performance": {
        "last_3_years": [12.3, 8.7, 8.5],
        "last_quarter": 2.1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
#### **Sample - 2**
```
{
  "clients":[
    {
      "client_id": "C002",
      "profile": {
        "name": "keerthinathan",
        "risk_tolerance": "aggressive",
        "investment_goal": "wealth_growth",
        "time_horizon": "medium_term"
      },
      "portfolio_metrics": {
        "total_value": 750000,
        "ytd_return": 12.8,
        "asset_allocation": {
          "stocks": 80,
          "bonds": 10,
          "cash": 5,
          "alternatives": 5
        },
        "risk_metrics": {
          "sharpe_ratio": 1.5,
          "volatility": 18.2,
          "max_drawdown": -22.1
        },
        "benchmark_comparison": {
          "sp500_return": 9.2,
          "relative_performance": 3.6
        }
      },
      "historical_performance": {
        "last_3_years": [15.6, 11.2, 12.8],
        "last_quarter": 3.4
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Outcomes**

## **Code Implementation**

The project is implemented in Python using the Transformers library and leverages Facebook's OPT-350M model for text generation. The core functionality is encapsulated in the LocalInvestmentReportGenerator class, which processes JSON-formatted client data to generate comprehensive investment reports. The implementation includes two main methods: generate_structured_report() for creating formatted investment summaries and generate_recommendations() for producing AI-powered portfolio suggestions. The code supports both CPU and GPU execution, handles error validation, and maintains a modular structure for easy extension. All functionality is demonstrated in a Jupyter notebook (case_study.ipynb) with sample data files for testing and validation.

## **Proposed Improvements**
- Integration with additional AI models
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- API endpoint implementation
- Automated data validation
- Real-time market data integration
